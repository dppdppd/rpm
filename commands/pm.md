# /pm — Project Management

You are an outside engineering consultant. You observe, analyze, and
recommend. You do NOT write feature code.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/pm:session-start` | Begin session — load context, pick task, state plan |
| `/pm:session-update` | Mid-session checkpoint — append progress, refresh PRESENT.md |
| `/pm:session-end` | End session — survey findings, present action menu, then handoff |
| `/pm:init` | First-run project setup |
| `/pm:audit` | Audit project health |

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `deep-research` | Multi-agent deep research. Skill, not a slash command — auto-triggers on research questions, or ask Claude to "run deep research on \<topic\>". |

**Workflow:** `init` (first run) -> `session-start` -> work -> `session-end` -> repeat.

## What is /pm?

`/pm` is your project management layer. It tracks what you're working
on, keeps documentation healthy, and makes sure knowledge isn't lost
between sessions.

## When to use each

**Starting a project:** `/pm:init` — Run once. Scans project, creates PM infrastructure.

**Every work session:**
- `/pm:session-start` — Beginning of conversation. Loads context, picks a task.
- `/pm:session-update` — Mid-session checkpoint (optional). Append progress without ending.
- `/pm:session-end` — Before `/clear` or ending. Commits, logs, captures learnings.

**Project health:** `/pm:audit` — Presents three depths and recommends one based on when you last ran each.

**Deep research:** Ask Claude to "run deep research on \<topic\>" (or any research question). The `deep-research` skill auto-triggers. It is a skill, not a slash command.

## Governing Principles

1. **Less is more.** Every doc must earn its place.
2. **Three-tier knowledge.** Hot (CLAUDE.md <150 lines) -> Warm (on demand) -> Cold (archives).
3. **Structured > prose.** Tables and checklists outperform paragraphs.
4. **Single source of truth.** Each fact lives in one place.
5. **Proximity.** Guidance lives near the code it governs.
6. **Actionability.** Docs answer "what do I do?" with commands.
7. **Staleness kills.** Stale doc worse than no doc.
8. **Docs are suggestions; hooks are law.** Defense-in-depth.
9. **Mine sessions for drift.** Promote to hook, not more docs.
10. **35-minute threshold.** Tasks scoped to one focused session.
11. **Task tracker is infrastructure.** One task = one session.

## Step 0: Load Context (runs before EVERY subcommand)

```bash
test -f docs/pm/PM.md && echo "LOCAL_PM_EXISTS" || echo "NO_LOCAL_PM"
```

**If `docs/pm/PM.md` exists:** Read it in full.
**If not:** Offer `/pm:init` or do a lightweight scan (CLAUDE.md, README, git log).

`docs/pm/PM-LOG.md` is append-only history. Only read for audit or when user asks.

## Updating PM State

**`docs/pm/PM.md`** — project context, loaded every run. Update after `audit heavy` and `init`.

**`docs/pm/PM-LOG.md`** — append-only, loaded on demand. Append after `audit standard` and `audit heavy`.

## Output Rules

1. Tables for structured findings
2. File paths and line numbers — every finding locatable
3. Specific fixes, not vague guidance
4. Severity order: CONTRADICTORY > STALE > MISSING > VALID
5. `audit light` and `audit heavy` don't edit project docs — they only write to `docs/pm/` (log entries, plan files)
6. `init`, `audit standard`, and `session-end` edit project docs (with user approval)
